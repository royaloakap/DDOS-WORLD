This program is made for those who would like their own API that can resolve FiveM CFX id's and grab details based on the server. Run the program locally, RDP, Linux OS or any virtual server and the program will make an API If you are going to run the program on a VPS/RDP then on line: 46 | be sure to replace 0.0.0.0 with your VPS/RDP IPv4

For the details when the cfx id has been resolved everything has been parsed into json data format to make those who want to run the API on their program make alot easier to code around it.

Feel free to edit the program to as you like as this is for educational purposes.
