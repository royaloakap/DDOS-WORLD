# DDOS-WORLD: Educational Network Security Project

## Introduction

DDOS-WORLD is a comprehensive educational framework designed to explore Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack mechanisms and defensive countermeasures. This project provides researchers, security professionals, and students with tools, scripts, and examples to understand the technical aspects of DDoS attacks while developing effective defense strategies in controlled environments.

## Project Purpose

This repository serves strictly educational and research purposes, aiming to:

- Provide in-depth understanding of network security vulnerabilities
- Demonstrate attack vectors and their technical implementations
- Develop robust defense mechanisms against various attack types
- Create a controlled environment for cybersecurity training

## Repository Structure

### 1. ANTI-DDOS
Collection of defensive solutions and mitigation scripts designed to protect network infrastructures against DDoS attacks. Includes traffic analysis tools, rate limiting implementations, and network hardening techniques.

### 2. API
API implementation examples for network management systems, including:
- CFX Resolver for FiveM server information retrieval
- GeoIP lookup services for geographical IP data
- PAPING/PING API for connectivity testing

### 3. BLOCKED_SSH_CONNECTION
Security scripts for SSH connection monitoring and protection, featuring automated blocking mechanisms and best practices for securing remote access.

### 4. BOT
Example bot implementations demonstrating automation capabilities, including Telegram integration with e-commerce functionality (Sellix).

### 5. BOTNET
Educational materials on botnet architectures and coordination mechanisms used in distributed attacks, with examples for understanding their operational principles.

### 6. C2
Command and Control (C2) infrastructure examples, illustrating the orchestration mechanisms behind coordinated attacks and their communication protocols.

### 7. CNC
Command and Control server configurations and implementation examples, demonstrating centralized attack management systems.

### 8. Dstat
Network and system performance monitoring tools for real-time visualization and analysis of traffic patterns during attack scenarios.

### 9. FUNNEL
Traffic redirection and concentration techniques, demonstrating how attack traffic can be channeled toward specific targets.

### 10. L7FIVEM-PATCH
Security patches specifically designed to protect FiveM game servers from Layer 7 (Application Layer) DDoS attacks.

### 11. METHODS
Comprehensive documentation of various DDoS attack methodologies with technical implementations, including:
- SYN Flood attacks
- UDP Flood attacks
- Amplification techniques
- Application layer attacks

### 12. OTHER STUFF
Supplementary scripts, tools, and documentation that enhance the overall educational value of the project.

### 13. PAPING
Implementation of TCP connectivity testing tools for network diagnostics and attack impact assessment.

### 14. PROXY
Proxy configuration examples for both defensive implementations and understanding traffic source obfuscation techniques.

### 15. SCAN
Network vulnerability scanning tools designed to identify potential security weaknesses that could be exploited in DDoS attacks.

### 16. SITEWEB
Web interfaces for real-time monitoring, visualization, and management of network security systems.

## Educational Objectives
